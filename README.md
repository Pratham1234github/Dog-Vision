## Introduction

Welcome to the End-to-End Multi-Class Dog Breed Prediction project! This project is an image classifier that identifies the breed of a dog using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

## Problem

The problem we aim to solve is dog breed identification. Given an image of a dog, our goal is to classify it into one of the 120 different dog breeds.

## Data

We are using the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). 
  This dataset contains:
- Over 10,000 images in the training set with labels.
- Over 10,000 images in the test set without labels.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of this project is based on prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image. You can find more details on the [Kaggle competition evaluation page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation).

## Features

- Utilizes deep learning and transfer learning techniques.
- Handles unstructured data, specifically images.
- Involves classifying images into 120 different dog breeds.

 Get the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) and place it in the appropriate directory.

 Train and test the model according to the project instructions.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your project. Include examples and code snippets that demonstrate how to perform dog breed predictions.

```python
# Example code for making predictions
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('your_model.h5')

# Load an image for prediction
image = load_image('dog_image.jpg')

# Preprocess the image (resize, normalize, etc.)
processed_image = preprocess_image(image)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(processed_image)

# Get the predicted dog breed
predicted_breed = decode_predictions(predictions)
print(f"The predicted breed is: {predicted_breed}")
```
